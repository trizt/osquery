## Guidelines for contributing features to osquery core

The software housed in this repo is known as osquery core. While there are occasional exceptions, contributions to core should abide by the following osquery guiding principles in order to be accepted:
1. osquery doesn’t change the state of the system
2. osquery doesn’t create network traffic to third parties
3. osquery’s endpoint binaries have a light memory footprint
4. osquery minimizes system overhead & maximizes performance
5. The query schema for osquery seeks uniformity between operating systems

For new features that do not align with the mission principles of core, you may build outside of osquery core in separate integrated processes called extensions: https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/osquery-sdk/.

## Does my contribution belong in Core or in an Extension?

Belongs in Core:
- Observes guiding principles
- Has been shared with and approved by osquery project maintainers as a new feature in Core
- Meets Facebook's testing and quality standards (see CONTRIBUTING.md)

Belongs in an extension:
- Might not observe the osquery guiding principles
- Has not been shared with or approved by Facebook as a new feature in Core 
- Expands the scope of use for osquery beyond endpoint monitoring
- Integrates with a proprietary or esoteric tool that is not widely applicable

## osquery core contribution process

All osquery development occurs in feature branches and all contributions occur via GitHub Pull Requests. All code must be reviewed, even if it's written by members of the core team, so following the code review process is critical to successful osquery development.

## Git workflow

Please do all of your development in a feature branch, on your own fork of osquery. You should clone osquery normally, like this:

```
git clone git@github.com:facebook/osquery.git
```

Then, your "remote" should be set up as follows:

```
$ cd osquery
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:facebook/osquery.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitHub.com:facebook/osquery.git (push)
```

Now, use the GitHub UI to fork osquery to your personal GitHub organization. Then, add the remote URL of your fork to git's local remotes:

```
$ git remote add $USER git@github.com:$USER/osquery.git
```

Now, your "remote" should be set up as follows:

```
$ git remote -v
marpaia git@github.com:marpaiagitaia/osquery.git (fetch)
marpaia git@github.com:marpaia/osquery.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:facebook/osquery.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitHub.com:facebook/osquery.git (push)
```

When you're ready to start working on a new feature, create a new branch:

```
$ git checkout -b my-feature
```

Write your code and when you're ready to put up a Pull Request, push your local branch to your fork:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "my awesome feature!"
$ git push -u $USER my-feature
```

Visit https://github.com/facebook/osquery and use the web UI to create a Pull Request. Once your pull request has gone through sufficient review and iteration, please squash all of your commits into one commit.

## Pull Request workflow

In most cases your PR should represent a single body of work. It is fine to change unrelated small-things like nits or code-format issues but make every effort to submit isolated changes. This makes documentation, references, regression tracking and if needed, a revert, easier.

## Updating Pull Requests

Pull requests will often need revision, most likely after the required code review from the friendly core development team. :D

Please feel free to add several commits to your Pull Request. When it comes time to merge into **master** all commits in a Pull Request will be squashed using GitHub's tooling into a single commit. The development team will usually choose to remove the commit body and keep the GitHub-appended `(#PR)` number in the commit title.

**You make updates to your pull request**

If the pull request needs changes, or you decide to update the content, consider 'amending' your previous commit:

```
$ git commit --amend
```

Like squashing, this changes the branch history so you'll need to force push the changes to update the pull request:

```
$ git push -f
```

In all cases, if the pull request is triggering automatic build/integration tests, the tests will rerun reflecting your changes.

### Linking issues

Once you submit your pull request, link the GitHub issue which your Pull Request implements. To do this, if the relevant issue is #7, then simply type "#7" somewhere in the Pull Request description or comments. This links the Pull Request with the issue, which makes things easier to track down later on.

### Adding the appropriate labels

To facilitate development, osquery developers adhere to a particular label workflow. The core development team will assign labels as appropriate.

#### "ready for review" vs "in progress"

Pull Requests are a great way to track the on-going development of an existing feature. For this reason, if you create a Pull Request and it's not ready for review just yet, attach the "in progress" label. If the Pull Request is ready for review, attach the "ready for review" label. Once the "ready for review" label has been applied, a member of the osquery core team will review your Pull Request.

#### Topic labels

Are you creating a new osquery table? Attach the **virtual tables** label.

Are you in some way altering build/test infrastructure? Attach the **build/test infrastructure** label.

Are you fixing a memory leak? Attach the **memory leak** label.

The pattern here should be pretty obvious. Please put the appropriate effort into attaching the appropriate labels to your Pull Request.

## Unit Test expectations

All code that you submit to osquery should include automated tests. See the [unit testing guide](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/unit-tests/) for instructions on how to create tests.

## Memory leak expectations

osquery runs in the context of long running processes. It's critical that there are no memory leaks in osquery code. All code should be thoroughly tested for leaks. See the [memory leak testing guide](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/deployment/performance-safety/) for more information on how to test your code for memory leaks.

When you submit a Pull Request, please consider including the output of a valgrind analysis.

## Calling systems tools

If you think that shelling out and executing a bash command is a good idea, it's not.

If you want to call a system executable or call system libraries via a tool, use the underlying C/C++ APIs that the tool uses to implement your functionality. Several tables (kextstat, processes, nvram, last, etc) were created by dissecting core systems tools and using the underlying APIs.

It's worth noting that you should exercise caution when copying code of any kind, especially core systems tools. Often times, core utilities developers recognize that their software will only be executed in the context of short-lived processes. For this reason, there are often memory leaks in the default behavior of these utilities. Put care into ensuring that you don't unknowingly introduce memory leaks into osquery.
